reduce_data — Construct quasi-panel for rolling entry matching.

For each treated unit at entry time t, selects their covariates at t-lookback.
For controls, creates one observation per treatment entry period (so controls
can serve as matches for multiple cohorts).

    ----------
    data : pl.DataFrame
        Panel data with treat, time, entry, id columns and covariates.
